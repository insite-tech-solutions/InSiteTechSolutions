    description:
      `An open-source scientific image analysis platform that provides biologists with a low-code/no-code solution for studying biomolecular condensates. Built on top of the popular napari image viewer, PyCAT-Napari streamlines complex analysis workflows into an intuitive, user-friendly graphical interface. The application equips researchers with a comprehensive suite of specialized tools for image segmentation, quantitative feature extraction, and advanced colocalization analysis. It features several pre-built, end-to-end analysis pipelines tailored for common biological research questions, such as characterizing in-cellulo condensates and analyzing fibril structures. The integrated condensate analysis provided the sensitivity and robustness needed to quantify saturation concentration of proteins in living cells, allowing investigation into the sequence grammar of proteins and nucleic acids. In addition, the platform's modular design and integration with napari's ecosystem make it a powerful and accessible tool for cutting-edge biological research.`,

      `A comprehensive migration and modernization of an academic lab website, transforming the original site into a sleek, accessible, and feature-rich platform on Squarespace. The redesign focused on both public-facing outreach and information, as well as internal operational tools. On the front end, the site now features a modernized aesthetic, updated branding, and a new Outreach blog-style section to promote scientific communication and community engagement. Behind the scenes, a secure Members Portal was introduced to streamline access to internal resources, including aggregated protocols, ordering procedures, and shared data repositories — greatly enhancing efficiency and onboarding for lab personnel. The upgrade also addressed numerous usability issues, implemented content architecture improvements, and future-proofed the site with modular, scalable features. This work highlights the power of combining intuitive no-code platforms with custom integrations to meet the specialized needs of scientific research teams.`,

    description:
      `Advanced photonics research that automated the design of high-performance, nanoscale photonic structures for next-generation particle-on-a-chip accelerators. Developed a novel optimization pipeline integrating Lumerical FDTD electromagnetic field simulations with custom algorithms featuring basin hopping global optimization to design devices that precisely control and boost electron energy. The breakthrough adjoint-based method with field gradient computation cut the computational cost of optimization—compared to traditional approaches—by such an extraordinary degree that it enabled robust convergence for complex problems in a non-convex parameter space with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom. The research successfully simulated the first-ever non-periodic structures capable of generating arbitrarily complex, non-sinusoidal accelerating fields (sawtooth and superposition waveforms) through multi-cell electromagnetic interactions and field superposition analysis. Created comprehensive visualization tools and an empirical model for predicting optimal design parameters—providing crucial insights for future accelerator development.`,

The app provided a contactless repair drop-off solution, allowing customers to initiate service without staff interaction. Through an intuitive touchscreen interface, users could select their device type (e.g., iPhone, iPad, MacBook), choose common repair services (e.g., screen replacement, battery replacement), and input their contact information. Once submitted, the system automatically generated a service ticket and airprinted a thermal label, which customers would affix to their device before placing it in a secure dropbox — enabling safe, organized, and traceable repair drop-offs.`,

    description:
      `A deep dive into hybrid quantum-classical computing with a comprehensive implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. This project tackles multiple variants of the Maximum Satisfiability (MAX-SAT) problem, including Max-Cut on ring graphs (MAX-2-SAT) and general MAX-3-SAT with arbitrary boolean clauses. The implementation features a robust pipeline built with Python and Google's Cirq framework. It constructs parameterized quantum circuits that encode problem Hamiltonians, using standard ZZ gates for Max-Cut and novel, custom-built 3-qubit gates for the more complex MAX-3-SAT instances. A classical Nelder-Mead optimizer iteratively refines the circuit parameters to navigate the solution space and find high-quality approximate solutions. The project includes extensive performance analysis, calculating approximation ratios by benchmarking QAOA results against a classical brute-force solver and demonstrating performance scaling with increased circuit depth.`,
